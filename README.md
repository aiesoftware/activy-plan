#### The domain

As a User, I want to:
```
- See activities that are available during my stay
- Book myself and/or other members of my party onto activities
- Remove myself or other members of my party from activities we are book on
- Watch activities and become alerted if they become available
- Receive a morning alert detailing today's upcoming activities
```

As an Admin User, I will need to:
```
- Create new activities and assign them to slots within the week
- Edit/Remove activities that have been created
- View the participants currently enrolled onto each activity
- Manually trigger alerts to participants for a specific activity for unexpected updates
```
